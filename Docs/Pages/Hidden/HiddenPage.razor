# Hidden

<p class=""description"">Quickly and responsively toggle the visibility value of components and more with the hidden utilities.</p>

All elements are visible unless **they are explicitly hidden**.
To ease integration with Material-UI's [responsive breakpoints](/customization/breakpoints/),
this component can be used to hide any content,
or you can use it in conjunction with the [`Grid`](/components/grid/) component.

## Installing with Nuget

You can [install Hidden package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skclusive.Material.Hidden/) by typing the below command in your terminal:

`dotnet add package Skclusive.Material.Hidden`

Then, you can import it in your _Imports.razor.

```csharp
@using Skclusive.Material.Hidden;
```

## How it works

Hidden works with a range of breakpoints e.g. `xsUp` or `mdDown`, or one or more breakpoints e.g. `only='sm'` or `only={['md', 'xl']}`.
Ranges and individual breakpoints can be used simultaneously to achieve very customized behavior.
The ranges are inclusive of the specified breakpoints.

```js
innerWidth  |xs      sm       md       lg       xl
            |--------|--------|--------|--------|-------->
width       |   xs   |   sm   |   md   |   lg   |   xl

smUp        |   show | hide
mdDown      |                     hide | show

```
## Breakpoint up

Using any breakpoint `up` property, the given *children* will be hidden *at or above* the breakpoint.

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.BreakpointUp, Skclusive.Material.Docs""}}

## Breakpoint down

Using any breakpoint `down` property, the given *children* will be hidden *at or below* the breakpoint.

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.BreakpointDown, Skclusive.Material.Docs""}}

## Breakpoint only

Using the breakpoint `only` property, the given *children* will be hidden *at* the specified breakpoint(s).

The `only` property can be used in two ways:

- list a single breakpoint
- list an array of breakpoints

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.BreakpointOnly, Skclusive.Material.Docs""}}

## Integration with Grid

It is quite common to alter `Grid` at different responsive breakpoints, and in many cases, you want to hide some of those elements.
