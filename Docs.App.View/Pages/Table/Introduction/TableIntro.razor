# Tables

<p class=""description"">Data tables display sets of data. They can be fully customized.</p>

[Data tables](https://material.io/design/components/data-tables.html) display information in a way thatâ€™s easy to scan, so that users can look for patterns and insights. They can be embedded in primary content, such as cards.

Data tables can include:

- A corresponding visualization
- Navigation
- Tools to query and manipulate data

When including tools, they should be placed directly above or below the table.

## Structure

A data table contains a header row at the top that lists column names, followed by rows for data.

Checkboxes should accompany each row if the user needs to select or manipulate data.

For accessibility, the first column is set to be a `<th>` element, with a `scope` of `""row""`. This enables screen readers to identify a cell's value by it's row and column name.
