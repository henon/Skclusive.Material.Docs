## When to use

- [Checkboxes vs. Switches](https://uxplanet.org/checkbox-vs-toggle-switch-7fc6e83f10b8)

## Accessibility

- It will render an element with the `checkbox` role not `switch` role since this
  role isn't widely supported yet. Please test first if assistive technology of your
  target audience supports this role properly. Then you can change the role with
  `<Switch inputProps={{ role: 'switch' }}>`
- All form controls should have labels, and this includes radio buttons, checkboxes, and switches. In most cases, this is done by using the `<label>` element ([FormControlLabel](/api/form-control-label/)).
- When a label can't be used, it's necessary to add an attribute directly to the input component.
  In this case, you can apply the additional attribute (e.g. `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `title`) via the `inputProps` property.

```html
<Switch
    Value=""checkedA""
    InputProps=""@(new Dictionary<string, object>{{ ""aria-label"", ""Switch A"" }})""
/>
```
