## Floating Action Buttons

A [floating action button](https://material.io/design/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html)
(FAB) performs the primary, or most common, action on a screen.
It appears in front of all screen content, typically as a circular shape with an icon in its center.
FABs come in two types: regular, and extended.

Only use a FAB if it is the most suitable way to present a screenâ€™s primary action.

Only one floating action button is recommended per screen to represent the most common action.
