# Text Fields

<p class=""description"">Text fields let users enter and edit text.</p>

[Text fields](https://material.io/design/components/text-fields.html) allow users to enter text into a UI. They typically appear in forms and dialogs.

## Installing with Nuget

You can [install Text package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skclusive.Material.Text/) by typing the below command in your terminal:

`dotnet add package Skclusive.Material.Text`

Then, you can import it in your _Imports.razor.

```csharp
@using Skclusive.Material.Text;
```

## TextField

The `TextField` wrapper component is a complete form control including a label, input and help text.

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View.TextFields, Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View""}}

> **Note:** This version of the text field is no longer documented in the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/), but Material-UI will continue to support it.

## Outlined

`TextField` supports outlined styling.

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View.OutlinedTextFields, Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View""}}

## Filled

`TextField` supports filled styling.

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View.FilledTextFields, Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View""}}

## Components

`TextField` is composed of smaller components (
[`FormControl`](/api/form-control/),
[`Input`](/api/input/),
[`FilledInput`](/api/filled-input/),
[`InputLabel`](/api/input-label/),
[`OutlinedInput`](/api/outlined-input/),
and [`FormHelperText`](/api/form-helper-text/)
) that you can leverage directly to significantly customize your form inputs.

You might also have noticed that some native HTML input properties are missing from the `TextField` component.
This is on purpose.
The component takes care of the most used properties, then it's up to the user to use the underlying component shown in the following demo-x. Still, you can use `inputProps` (and `InputProps`, `InputLabelProps` properties) if you want to avoid some boilerplate.

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View.ComposedTextField, Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View""}}

## Inputs

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View.StandardInputs, Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View""}}

## Customized inputs

Here are some examples of customizing the component. You can learn more about this in the
[overrides documentation page](/customization/components/).

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View.CustomizedInputs, Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View""}}

Customization does not stop at CSS, you can use composition to build custom components and give your app a unique feel.
Below is an example using the [`InputBase`](/api/input-base/) component, inspired by Google Maps.

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View.CustomizedInputBase, Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View""}}

## Input Adornments

`Input` allows the provision of `InputAdornment`.
These can be used to add a prefix, a suffix or an action to an input.
For instance, you can use an icon button to hide or reveal the password.

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View.InputAdornments, Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View""}}

### With icon

Icons can be specified as prepended or appended.

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View.InputWithIcon, Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View""}}

### Filled Input Adornments

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View.FilledInputAdornments, Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View""}}

### Outlined Input Adornments

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View.OutlinedInputAdornments, Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View""}}

## Layout

`TextField`, `FormControl` allow the specification of `margin` to alter the vertical spacing of inputs. Using
`none` (default) will not apply margins to the `FormControl`, whereas `dense` and `normal` will as well as alter
other styles to meet the specification.

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View.TextFieldMargins, Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View""}}

## Limitations

### Shrink

The input label ""shrink"" state isn't always correct.
The input label is supposed to shrink as soon as the input is displaying something.
In some circumstances, we can't determine the ""shrink"" state (number input, datetime input, Stripe input). You might notice an overlap.

![shrink](/static/images/text-fields/shrink.png)

To workaround the issue, you can force the ""shrink"" state of the label.
```html
<TextField InputLabelProps={{ shrink: true }} />
```
or
```html
<StandardInputLabel shrink>Count</InputLabel>
```

### Floating label

The floating label is absolutely positioned, it won't impact the layout of the page.
You need to make sure that the input is larger than the label to display correctly.

## Accessibility

In order for the text field to be accessible, **the input should be linked to the label and the helper text**. The underlying DOM nodes should have this structure.

```html
<div class=""form-control"">
  <label for=""my-input"">Email address</label>
  <input id=""my-input"" aria-describedby=""my-helper-text"" />
  <span id=""my-helper-text"">We'll never share your email.</span>
</div>
```

- If you are using the `TextField` component, you just have to provide a unique `id`.
- If you are composing the component:

```html
<FormControl>
  <StandardInputLabel For=""my-input"">Email address</InputLabel>
  <StandardInput Id=""my-input"" aria-describedby=""my-helper-text"" />
  <FormHelperText Id=""my-helper-text"">We'll never share your email.</FormHelperText>
</FormControl>
```

")" />
</div>
