## Components

`TextField` is composed of smaller components (
[`FormControl`](/api/form-control/),
[`Input`](/api/input/),
[`FilledInput`](/api/filled-input/),
[`InputLabel`](/api/input-label/),
[`OutlinedInput`](/api/outlined-input/),
and [`FormHelperText`](/api/form-helper-text/)
) that you can leverage directly to significantly customize your form inputs.

You might also have noticed that some native HTML input properties are missing from the `TextField` component.
This is on purpose.
The component takes care of the most used properties, then it's up to the user to use the underlying component shown in the following demo-x. Still, you can use `inputProps` (and `InputProps`, `InputLabelProps` properties) if you want to avoid some boilerplate.
