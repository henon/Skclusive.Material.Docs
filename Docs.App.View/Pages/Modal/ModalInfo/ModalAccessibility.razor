## Accessibility

(WAI-ARIA: https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#dialog_modal)

- Be sure to add `aria-labelledby=""id...""`, referencing the modal title, to the `Modal`.
Additionally, you may give a description of your modal with the `aria-describedby=""id...""` prop on the `Modal`.
```html
<Modal
  aria-labelledby=""modal-title""
  aria-describedby=""modal-description"">
  <h2 id=""modal-title"">
    My Title
  </h2>
  <p id=""modal-description"">
    My Description
  </p>
</Modal>
```
- The [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/dialog-modal/dialog.html) can help you set the initial focus on the most relevant element, based on your modal content.
- A modal window overlys on either the primary window or another modal window. Windows under a modal are **inert**. That is, users cannot interact with content outside an active modal window.
