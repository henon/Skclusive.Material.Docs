# Popover

<p class=""description"">A Popover can be used to display some content on top of another.</p>

Things to know when using the `Popover` component:

- The component is built on top of the [`Modal`](/components/modal/) component.
- The scroll and click away are blocked unlike with the [`Popper`](/components/popper/) component.
