# Popover

<p class=""description"">A Popover can be used to display some content on top of another.</p>

Things to know when using the `Popover` component:

- The component is built on top of the [`Modal`](/components/modal/) component.
- The scroll and click away are blocked unlike with the [`Popper`](/components/popper/) component.

## Installing with Nuget

You can [install Popover package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skclusive.Material.Popover/) by typing the below command in your terminal:

`dotnet add package Skclusive.Material.Popover`

Then, you can import it in your _Imports.razor.

```csharp
@using Skclusive.Material.Popover;
```

## Simple Popover

## Anchor playground

Use the radio buttons to adjust the `anchorOrigin` and `transformOrigin` positions.
You can also set the `anchorReference` to `anchorPosition` or `anchorEl`.
When it is `anchorPosition`, the component will, instead of `anchorEl`,
refer to the `anchorPosition` prop which you can adjust to set
the position of the popover.

## Mouse over interaction

This demonstrates how to use the `Popover` component to implement a popover behavior based on the mouse over event.
