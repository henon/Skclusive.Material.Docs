# Progress

<p class=""description"">Progress indicators commonly known as spinners, express an unspecified wait time or display the length of a process. The animation works with CSS, not JavaScript.</p>

[Progress indicators](https://material.io/design/components/progress-indicators.html) inform users about the status of ongoing processes, such as loading an app, submitting a form, or saving updates. They communicate an appâ€™s state and indicate available actions, such as whether users can navigate away from the current screen.

**Determinate** indicators display how long an operation will take.

**Indeterminate** indicators visualize an unspecified wait time.

#### Progress as a group

When displaying progress for a sequence of processes, indicate overall progress rather than the progress of each activity.
