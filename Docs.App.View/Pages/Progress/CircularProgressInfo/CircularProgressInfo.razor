## Circular

[Circular progress](https://material.io/design/components/progress-indicators.html#circular-progress-indicators) support both determinate and indeterminate processes.

- **Determinate** circular indicators fill the invisible, circular track with color, as the indicator moves from 0 to 360 degrees.
- **Indeterminate** circular indicators grow and shrink in size while moving along the invisible track.
