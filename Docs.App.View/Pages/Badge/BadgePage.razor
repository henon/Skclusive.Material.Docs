## Installing with Nuget

```

## Simple Badges

## Customized badges

Here are some examples of customizing the component. You can learn more about this in the [overrides documentation page](/customization/components/).

## Badge visibility

The visibility of badges can be controlled using the `invisible` property.

You can use the `horizontalAlignment` and `verticalAlignment` properties to move the badge to any corner of the wrapped element.
