## Changing the semantic element

The Typography component uses the `VariantMapping` property to associate a UI variant with a semantic element.
Itâ€™s important to realize that the style of a typography is independent from the semantic underlying element.

- You can change the underlying element for a one time occasion with the `Component` property:

```html
@* There is already an h1 in the page, let's not duplicate it. *@
<Typography
    Variant=""@TypographyVariant.H1""
    Component=""h2"">
    h1. Heading
</Typography>
```

## Accessibility

A few key factors to follow for an accessible typography:

- **Color**. Provide enough contrast between text and its background, check out the minimum recommended [WCAG 2.0 color contrast ratio](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast.html) (4.5:1).
- **Font size**. Use [relative units (rem)](/customization/typography/#font-size) to accommodate the user's settings.
- **Heading hierarchy**. [Don't skip](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/headings/) heading levels. In order to solve this problem, you need to [separate the semantics from the style](#changing-the-semantic-element).
