# Menus

<p class=""description"">Menus display a list of choices on temporary surfaces.</p>

A [Menu](https://material.io/design/components/menus.html) displays a list of choices on a temporary surface. It appears when the user interacts with a button, or other control.

## Installing with Nuget

You can [install Menu package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Skclusive.Material.Menu/) by typing the below command in your terminal:

`dotnet add package Skclusive.Material.Menu`

Then, you can import it in your _Imports.razor.

```csharp
@using Skclusive.Material.Menu;
```

## Simple Menu

Simple menus open over the anchor element by default (this option can be changed via props). When close to a screen edge, simple menus vertically realign to make sure that all menu items are completely visible.

Choosing an option should immediately ideally commit the option and close the menu.

**Disambiguation**: In contrast to simple menus, simple dialogs can present additional detail related to the options available for a list item or provide navigational or orthogonal actions related to the primary task. Although they can display the same content, simple menus are preferred over simple dialogs because simple menus are less disruptive to the user’s current context.

## Selected menus

If used for item selection, when opened, simple menus attempt to vertically align the currently selected menu item with the anchor element,
and the initial focus will be placed on the selected menu item.
The currently selected menu item is set using the `selected` property (from [ListItem](/api/list-item/)).
To use a selected menu item without impacting the initial focus or the vertical positioning of the menu, set the `variant` property to `menu`.

## Customized menus

Here is an example of customizing the component. You can learn more about this in the
[overrides documentation page](/customization/components/).

{{""demo"": ""Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View.CustomizedMenus, Skclusive.Material.Docs.App.View""}}

The `MenuItem` is a wrapper around `ListItem` with some additional styles.
You can use the same list composition features with the `MenuItem` component:

## Max height menus

If the height of a menu prevents all menu items from being displayed, the menu can scroll internally.

## Limitations

There is [a flexbox bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=327437) that prevents `text-overflow: ellipsis` from working in a flexbox layout.
You can use the `Typography` component with `noWrap` to workaround this issue:
