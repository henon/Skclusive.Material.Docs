## Alerts

Alerts are urgent interruptions, requiring acknowledgement, that inform the user about a situation.

Most alerts don't need titles.
They summarize a decision in a sentence or two by either:

- Asking a question (e.g. ""Delete this conversation?"")
- Making a statement related to the action buttons

Use title bar alerts only for high-risk situations, such as the potential loss of connectivity.
Users should be able to understand the choices based on the title and button text alone.

If a title is required:

- Use a clear question or statement with an explanation in the content area, such as ""Erase USB storage?"".
- Avoid apologies, ambiguity, or questions, such as “Warning!” or “Are you sure?”
